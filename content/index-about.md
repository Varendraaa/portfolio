# Hiya! I'm Varendra

I'm a fresh software developer with a focus on game and mobile app development. I'm currently interested in the applications of machine learning, and their implications on the development lifecycle.

I'm also an ex-geophysicist, with over 5 years experience in seismic data intepretation and management.
