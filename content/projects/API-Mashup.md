*** A web app that combines two APIs to make a useful application ***

**[See the code here](github link)**

## About
This was my second assignment for my Web Development Module at the University of Dundee.
It's written using HTML, CSS and Javascript, with support from JQuery and Material Design Bootstrap.
It was my first time working with Javascript and the JSON notation, and was developed over a period of 4 weeks.

It uses two API's for its functionality:
- [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
- [Ticketmaster API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/)

Initially, I looked at all freely available API's from this convenient [repository](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) and tried to figure out two things:

1. What app would I actually be interested in making?
2. What two API's would function well together to make a useful application?

I decided on putting together the two aforementioned API's to create an application that allows a user to check both the weather forecast and upcoming events in the area, simply by inputing a designated location. I was also inspired by the Windows 11 Weather app.
