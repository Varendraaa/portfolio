*I made this website using Hugo, specifically the Gokarna Theme.*

# Hi There!

I made this website primarily as a quick way to act as my developer portfolio, as I only know the basics of web developement (HTML, CSS and a bit of JS), and I'd want to spend a decent amount of time actually getting good at it before I decide to invest into making a completely self developed portfolio.

I initially looked into hosting the portfolio using Github's Jekyll static site generator, but a lot of the current themes are outdated, and documentation seemed pretty subpar.

### Enter Hugo
Hugo's themes seemed pretty good, and I spent quite a bit of time experimenting with a couple (PaperMod, Stack, and Adritian) before I settled on using Gokarna. I'm still experimenting with this, and there's a lot of features I'd like to add in to make this website a bit like I'd want it to look, but that's a problem for future me.

Anyway, I'll be chucking my projects up here and maybe some quick thoughts when I get a chance.

### Thanks for Stopping By!
